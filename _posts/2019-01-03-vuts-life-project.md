**Chapter 35: On Vut's life project.** 

Little Vut was a pretty bright guy who, after reading Da Vinci's biography, decided he wanted to be an inventor.

He tinkered with pretty much anything that connected to an electrical source for power since he was five. Nothing ever satisfied Vut's lust for knowledge and infinite curiosity: at 10 he build his first custom quantum PC. At 13 he was tearing down smart phones and music players. At 15 he completely disassembled an old V8 car engine only by writing down in a notebook what he thought each peace did.

Life was a "meh" challenge for him. In 2231 he graduated with honors from SciU, the most important science/tech college from Asphallatus, the 8th planet in the recently discovered M4-V system, from where the most important people in the tech world dropped out from: fellow tinkerer Melon Usk, an astrophysicist who loved to ruin movies for everyone on social media, and a couple of Apple CEOs, among others.

Vut tried to avoid personal relationships that could potentially distract him from his lifelong goal of "making a product so stupid that would create ripples through history" (1), and he finally decided that this would be the day that his creation would finally emerge. 

He had taken the world by surprise before with inventions such as the automated pizza cutter, an intravenous nanomachine-based GPS for convicted criminals and jealous partners, and the mechanical and easy to install ReKidney, which would go on to live as the greatest medical advancement of the century but ultimately would become his worst commercial failure. For more examples on this matter, please check out "Big Complex Money Compendium Chapter 172: On Trying To Help Humanity Instead of Making Money, and How To Market Your Products For A Literally Dying Audience". 

But he wouldnt let that take him down. 

Vut seated in his room during a hot summer night from October 2237.

After his parents passing last year, he basically transformed the modest house into a big workshop, tools and parts scattered everywhere, where he would sleep on the floor whenever the tiredness would find him.

After searching through the countless cables and file cabinets lying around in his room, he took a seat on the lonely chair that accompanied the desk at the middle of the room, and looked through the pages of his old notebooks searching for his notes on the project. He quickly made a list of materials and began working on his idea. It was the time. It was his destiny. He would finally show the world what he was worth.

On November 2237, a big conference was organized at the now run down Steve Jobs theater in the mostly abandoned planet Earth. Vut felt like he had a connection to the place, since his mother was an earthling.

News ran rampant on the matter: the famous inventor of the automated pizza cutter would show his latest tech development. The biggest news outlets in the universe were invited to the event, while Fox News and Wired had to bribe their way into the building.

The lights finally were turned off, and everyone closed their laptop lids. Vut walked onto the stage wearing his usual black t-shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers. He looked as always did: like an old, short haired, glasses wearing 20 something dude.

He didn't spoke a word. Everyone was anxiously waiting for what he would show.

He smiled at the audience with a shit eating grin, when an olographic image materialized next to him:
A pair of blue headphones.


Cause you see, while Vut was the biggest inventor of his time, he wasn't big. I mean that he was short. Pretty short. Little Vut wasn't exactly a friendly name, and was more of a way to mock him because of his height.

And that wasn't all. He fucking hated tall people with a passion. They would always get the groceries from the tallest places at the supermarket, and would block his view at the cinema.

It was bullshit.

So he decided to make a product that would hurt them.

He finally spoke, and the world was amazed at his product. 

-Introducing: The HeadVolumePhones

The concept was pretty simple: tall people would have bigger heads than someone his height. Which would mean they'd need to use extend the headband in order for the speakers to reach their ears.

So he built a couple of headphones that regulated volume based on how extended the headband was. The more extended it was, the higher volume the music would play.

"I wouldn't kill them but at least I would make them deaf. Seriously, fuck tall people. How come nobody can see the problem besides me?" where his lasts words after he died on 2342, before he had the chance to see space nazism rise.


Without any warning, the product became the hottest thing of summer 2237. The headphones were flying off the shelves.

Money was flying into Vut's pockets.

Statistics about deaf people had to be redone since the designer couldn't hear how his bosses told him that the colours he choose were the wrong ones.

Studies where done about the case.

How could people be so stupid to buy something with a fixed volume based on your head ratio?

Headlines where written. "Are the zillenials killing the music mixing industry?"

We wouldn't know, but they were certainly reviving the Audiology one.

Vut faced a lawsuit, which he lost big time since he refused to testify with a tall judge.

But that is a story for the "How To lose Money Fast By Being Intolerant" compendium. It also has a pretty sizable section about Melon Usk.
